# Plant Tycoon Game (HTML, CSS, JS)

This project is a simplified implementation of a Plant Tycoon style game, built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Gameplay Overview (Planned & Current)

Players will be able to:
- Buy seeds
- Plant seeds in garden plots
- Watch plants grow over time
- (Eventually) Water and care for plants
- Move mature plants to a nursery
- Sell mature plants for profit
- (Eventually) Cross-breed plants to discover new species
- (Eventually) Manage finances and upgrade tools/shop items

## Current Status

- Basic HTML structure for garden, stats, and shop.
- Basic CSS for layout.
- Initial JavaScript for:
    - Buying 'common' seeds.
    - Planting seeds in empty plots.
    - Basic plant growth simulation (time-based).
    - Moving mature plants to a nursery.
    - Selling plants from the nursery.
    - Tracking money.

## How to Play (Locally)

1. Clone this repository (if applicable) or ensure all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Future Development Ideas

- [ ] More diverse plant species with unique characteristics (growth time, value, appearance).
- [ ] Plant genetics and cross-pollination mechanics.
- [ ] Plant health system (needs watering, susceptible to pests).
- [ ] Soil types and fertilizers.
- [ ] Research system for discovering new plants or improving existing ones.
- [ ] More interactive shop with various items (tools, special seeds, etc.).
- [ ] Visual feedback for plant stages (seedling, growing, mature, flowering).
- [ ] Saving and loading game progress (e.g., using `localStorage`).
- [ ] More polished UI and animations.
